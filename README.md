Welcome on my 5th **Ludum Dare** Compo entry!

Man, this theme was **HARD**. Not just hard but really **HARD**.  
I brainstormed during hours finding a pitch fitting for this theme, so there you go *(narrator voice activated)*:

> Time is collapsing. You, the hero of this story, have to once again save the world by fighting the Time itself, avoiding traps and getting [deeper and deeper](https://github.com/Srynetix/deep-space-beat).
> 

Here's what the **Time** will do to block you:
- *every 10 seconds*, you will be weaker, slower
- *every 10 seconds*, you will receive a special effect in your face
- but fortunately for you, if you break the *time locks*, you will take precious seconds from the **Time** itself.

If you are too slow to finish the level, consider yourself **frozen until the end of the ages** :hourglass:.

Make sure to finish all the levels, and let me know if you enjoyed the game :wink:.  
...ah and put your headphones on, make sure you play with sound :notes:!
